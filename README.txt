Duke is a fast deduplication and record linkage engine written in
Java, based on Lucene. No documentation is included in the
distribution. To see how to use it, see

  http://code.google.com/p/duke/wiki/GettingStarted

instead.

You may also want to look at the examples in doc/example-data,
particularly dogfood.xml and countries.xml.
